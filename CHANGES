 - use browser.frame(:name => "name") or browser.frame(:name, "name") syntax instead
* :index => 0 is used as a default specifier if nothing is specified:
 - browser.div(:id => "id").table.tr is same as browser.div(:id => "id").table(:index => 0).tr(:index => 0)
* all collection methods accept now specifiers too:
 - browser.divs(:class => "someclass").each {|div| puts div.class_name} # => "someclass"

== Version 1.6.0

This release merges the Watir and FireWatir projects. It contains many
compatibility fixes,
as well as a new browser-independent interface your tests can use to allow you
to specify the browser at run time.

We have also updated our existing support for modal dialogs so that it now works
with Ruby 1.8.6. Users who have been using Ruby 1.8.2 because of this will now
need to upgrade to Ruby 1.8.6.

This release also contains many other fixes. Details below.

Watir and FireWatir are still distributed as separate gems. Installing the
Watir gem will automatically install FireWatir. Both gems now use common code
contained in the "commonwatir" gem.

This release is fully backwards compatible with previous versions of Watir and
FireWatir. Your existing scripts should continue to run without change.

=== Installation

To install both Watir and FireWatir:

  gem update --system
  gem install watir

To only install FireWatir (e.g. on Mac or Linux)

  gem update --system
  gem install firewatir

To enable Firefox to work with Watir, you will also need to install the
JSSH plugin. See this page for details.
http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FireWatir+Installation#FireWatirInstallation-3%29InstalltheJSSHFirefoxExtension

=== New Features
You can now replace references to Watir::IE.new (or FireWatir::Firefox.new)
with Watir::Browser.new to allow you to
specify which browser to run your tests against at run time. Details:
http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Browser.new

It takes two lines of code to allow Browser.new to support an additional Watir
implementation. The two lines necessary for SafariWatir (on Mac) are provided.
(See commonwatir/lib/watir/browsers.rb).

In addition to 'browser', options supported by Browser.new (on IE only right now)
are 'speed' and 'visible'.

Unit tests no longer run from the gems. You will need to get the source if you
want to run the unit tests.

=== Compatibility Fixes
* FireWatir now raises Watir exceptions.
* FireWatir now supports multiple attributes for most page elements.
* Watir now supports multiple attributes for most page elements.
* Added support to FireWatir for many more element types.
* Added Radio#checked? and Checkbox#checked? methods to FireWatir.
* Now firefox.radio().set will click a radio button (as does IE) even if it
  is already set. This is important if there is javascript attached to the
  radio button.
* TextField#set now respects the maxlength of the field. Previously, FireWatir
  could overrun the limit. FireWatir::TextField.maxlength now works correctly.
* Watir::SelectList#includes? and #selected now accept regexp arguments.
  This functionality is still missing from FireWatir, but it is in Celerity.
  From Jari Bakken. Fixes #261.
* FireWatir::Element#disabled is fixed.
* Added method Watir::Table#row_count_excluding_nested_tables. This works like
  FireWatir::Table#row_count.
* Watir#wait_until is now available to FireWatir.
* Fixed versioning. With FireWatir 1.2.1, FireWatir::Firefox::VERSION
  actually reported '1.1.1.'.
* FireWatir will now automatically starts Firefox on Mac (as it did previously
  on Windows and Linux).

=== IE Fixes
* Fix for: form field named "submit" causes "submit" method to not work.
  Closes #223.
* Calling ie.radio().set now scrolls the page to the control, as with other
  controls. Thanks to Jonathan Kohl for the fix. Closes #172.
* Fixed ie.speed, which was returning ":fast" when speed was actually ":zippy".
* Fix for visible? method not being inherited correctly. From Alan Baird.
  Closes #253
* Added ie.forms method. Thanks to Jarmo P.
* Fix for "undefined method 'document'" error that was occuring when loading
  pages with frames that were slow to load. Reported here:
  http://groups.google.com/group/watir-general/browse_thread/thread/ddde6251e30588c9
* Fixed accessing checkboxes and radio buttons using :ole_object on IE.
  Closes #217.

=== Unit Test Improvements
* Unit tests no longer can be run from a gem install. Rather, you need to run them
  from a complete source tree.
* New rake targets for Watir: test and cruise, each of which runs the core tests.
* Numerous fixes and cleanup to the unit test suite.
* The unit tests both both Watir and FireWatir now use the new Browser.new
  interface and can be run
  against either implementation (Watir::IE or FireWatir::Firefox or others for
  that matter). See this page for details.
  http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Running+Unit+Tests+in+Development
* Added tagging to unit tests. Tests which have known failures are now tagged
  as ":fails_on_ie" or ":fails_on_firefox".
* Added coverage modes for running unit tests. These are documented on the wiki
  page cited above.
* Updated tests that were still using obsolete Watir 1.0 interfaces.
* Started merging the Watir test suites into commonwatir.
* General test clean up.
* Test failures due to not setting IE security settings will now issue
  helpful error message telling you how to fix your IE security settings.

=== Structural Changes
* Moved library files into "lib" directories. Now Watir is like all the other
  Ruby projects.
* Moved FireWatir classes into the FireWatir module.
* Removed examples. They are now on the wiki.
* Simplified code by removing duplication and unused code.
* The watir-console now works from the development tree.
* Renamed IE.defaults to IE.options and IE.defaults= to IE.set_options.
* Added top-level "rake gems" target. Only works on windows right now.


== Watir 1.5.6

To install this:

  "gem update --system"
  "gem install watir"

Installer Fix

This update fixes an installer problem in Watir 1.5.5 that affected some users.
If you installed 1.5.5 without error, there is no reason to get this update.

== Watir 1.5.5.

New Features

* Multiple attributes can now be specified for these elements:
  li, ul, map, area, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. (This was claimed to work earlier,
  but never did.)
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-196

Bug Fixes

* Statements such at ie.table().row() now work (no longer private).
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-117
* Fixed bug with images method when used with anything but ie. (Paul Rogers)
  E.g. ie.div().images. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-211
* Fixed intermittent bug with ie.file_field().set. (Tomislav Car)
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-210
* When installing Watir 1.5.4 you could get extra, confusing
  questions. This shouldn't happen anymore.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-209
* Improved error message when element is not found using multiple attributes.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-181
* Made examples and unit tests somewhat better examples: removed unnecessary
  "include Watir" statements; started using "browser" instead of "$ie"; use
  new methods 'goto_page' and 'uses_page' (this last improves performance of
  unit tests).
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-159
* Moved brittle unit test that was causing cascading failures; renamed another
  that was causing a namespace collision.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-92

== Version 1.5.4

New Features

* Add new speed, :zippy. This is like fast, but, in effect, it does a TextField#value= instead of a TextField#set. If you have specific text fields that you never want this to happen to, use ie.text_field(:how, what).requires_typing.set instead.
  http://svn.openqa.org/fisheye/changelog/watir/?cs=1295
* Add support for Chinese input as supplied by Vincent Xu.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-71.

Bug Fixes

* Add dependency on windows-pr 0.6.6, which seems to be necessary on Vista.
* Fix for bug in IE.close_others provided by Paul Taylor.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-194
* Fix for error when using verify_equal with ci_reporter, provided by Marcog.
  http://svn.openqa.org/fisheye/changelog/watir/?cs=1301

== Version 1.5.3

Bug fixes and minor cleanup.

* Fix text areas bugs.
* Fix warning messages caused by redefined constants.
* Break out watir.rb into multiple files.
* Fix [WTR-90] error when running tests when installing gem.
  http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-90
* Fix tests.
* Update documentation.

Major Changes in 1.5.2
    Support for IE's Modal Dialogs.
      showModalDialog()
    Any method can be used to specify an element (:text, :class, etc.).
      ie.button(:class,'Button Menu').click
      ie.div(:text, 'Type').text_field(:class, 'TextInput-input').set('my value')
      ie.button(:text, 'Save').click
    One can now use multiple attributes to specify an element.
      ie.span(:class =>'Label', :text => 'Add new').click

Other Changes in 1.5.2
    * Migrated IE.new_process from watir/contrib and improved its reliability. We now recommend IE.new_process over IE.new as a way to avoid numerous errors detailed in http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-150.
    * Added IE.start_process. This works like IE.start, but uses the new_process mechanism to start IE.
    * Added IE.new_window and IE.start_window. This are synonyms for IE.new and IE.start.
    * Added dependency on the win32-process gem.
    * Added IE.each, which iterates through the various IE windows currently open.
    * Updated WindowHelper and watir/dialog to work with IE7

    * Fixed bug in Element#parent and updated unit test.
    * HTML value attributes are checked as strings before converting, updated unit tests.
    * Watir::wait_until clean up.
    * Fix for winclicker when installed in directory with spaces.

    * Fix for bug in element_by_xpath. http://www.mail-archive.com/wtr-general@rubyforge.org/msg06742.html
    * "Wait" method now is called recursively into nested frames. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-107
    * Rdocs now only include the core Watir library (not contrib).
    * Improve error reporting when IE#modal_dialog isn't found.
    * Add method "ModalDialog#exists?"
    * Add Watir::Win32.window_exists? method.
    * Fix for winclicker setComboBoxTest and setTextBoxText http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-124
    * Improved Support for IE7

        o Fix for IE7 with winclicker.
        o Fix for check_for_http_error in IE7. http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-141
    *  Fix for IE7 on ie.exists? http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-123
    * Rubyw is now used in winclicker to bypass command line windows.
    * Autoit is registered before being used.

    * ie.file_field has been fixed and unit test updated.
    * rdoc generation has been fixed.
    * page checker has been moved from the default behavior into contrib/page_checker.rb
    * Fix for intermittent crashes occuring when using Watir with Ruby version > 1.8.2.
    * Fix for http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-86
        This fix prevents the Watir-modified win32ole.so library (compiled against 1.8.2) from being used.
    * Added Element#parent
    * Add new methods Element#after? and Element#before?
    * Added support for relative specifiers. E.g.:
        link = $ie.link(:class => 'addtocart', :after? => @headline)
    * Removed NAVIGATION_CHECKER from Watir.rb, added to contrib. This fixes rdoc generation and stops the frame access exception being thrown in the default installation.
    * Open-code calls to def_creator, for easier debugging and rdoc generation of factory methods.
    * Winclicker fix for too many callbacks defined error.
    * Patch for rspec API changes
    * You can now reference an iframe using IE#frame(:id, 'whatever'). Jira 109
    * Added 'map' and 'area' element support.

    * The click_no_wait method now works in frames.
    * Released new IE.new_process method to 'watir/contrib/ie-new-process'. This starts up a new IE process for each IE window, which is really how it should be done. To close these use IE#kill. Any one getting intermittent RPC errors when opening windows may want to use this instead.
    * Several examples have been updated.
    * Moved enabled_popup to a new contrib directory.
    * Added several tests.
